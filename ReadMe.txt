War Card Game:

This is a C++ program that implements the card game War. All the files necessary to run the program are included. CMake and GitHub are required to run this program. 

The source code and header files are hosted on GitHub in a personal remote repository. Clone the repository using the following commands in a terminal window: 'git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git' followed by 'cd your-repo'

Download all the files that were submitted. Next, open up a terminal window to run commands for CMake. First navigate to the root directory of the downloaded files using the 'cd' command. Using the "mkdir build" followed by the "cd build" commands to create a build folder and open it. Next use the command 'cmake + path to root directory'. Lastly, enter the 'make' command. After doing all of this, an executable file will appear in the build folder that runs the program for the card game. 

Once the executable file is opened, the user can review their hand on the screen. Additionally, they will be prompted to select a card to play for the round, in which the user can enter the rank of the card they desire to choose. Both the user’s and computer’s cards will then be displayed on the screen, as well as a message stating which opponent wins the round. Additionally, the user’s updated hand will appear below. In the event of a war scenario, where both players play the same value rank, a message stating the initiation of a war will appear. Next, the user will be prompted twice to select which cards they choose to wager in the war scenario. After doing so, these cards will be displayed, as well as the third, final card for both the user and the computer (which are both randomly chosen). Finally, a message displaying which player won the round will appear, and again the user’s hand will be updated and displayed accordingly. Once one of the players, either the user or the computer, has an empty hand, a message will be displayed stating the winner of the entire game.

If an invalid input for the card selection is entered, an error message will be displayed and the user will be prompted again.
